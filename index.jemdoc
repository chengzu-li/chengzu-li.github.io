== About me
I am a first-year PhD student in Computation, Cognition and Language at [https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/ Language Technology Lab] in the University of Cambridge, supervised by [https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/ Prof. Anna Korhonen] and [https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/ Dr. Ivan Vulić].
My research is supported by Cambridge Trust.
I am a member of [https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/ Jesus College].

Before starting my PhD, I received my MPhil degree in Advanced Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science, supervised by [https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/ Prof. Simone Teufel], supported by Cambridge Trust.
I was an undergraduate student in Automation at [http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/ Xi'an Jiaotong University].


== Research
I'm generally interested in different topics in NLP and machine learning. My research interests include semantic parsing, structural knowledge, large language models and their applications.
I am currently exploring and focusing on:
- Grounding large language models in physical environments
- Multimodal reasoning with vision and language
- In-context learning and other learning paradigms.

I'm also interested in the possible applications of Gaussian Process and causality in NLP area.
